# USC Dashboard

After completing my journey at the University of Southern California I made a dashboard which summarizies my Masters in Applied Data Science from 2021 - 2023. 
Hoping that this would be helpful for any upcoming students at USC!

Click <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vedaanti.baliga/viz/USCDashboard_16856561525930/Expenses?publish=yes" target="_blank">here</a> to see the tableau notebook.


This repository has the code for the "Expenses" tab in the tableau workbook. I extracted all the transactions from my 2 years at USC and then used it to make an analysis for my expenditure. I wanted 
to get the categories for each transactions and hence used NLP and Data Analysis to label data.

This repository has the following notebooks :

1. EDA_before : Exploratory analysis for all transactions
2. Cleaning_data : Cleaned the data after doing EDA
3. EDA_after : Exploratory analysis after cleaning the data
4. Preprocessing_data : Pre-processed data after doing some more EDA in EDA_after
5. Expenses_final : Final notebook in which the modeling was done using BERT
